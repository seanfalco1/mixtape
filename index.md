# Tables

| Test  | Column    | Appearance    |
|------:|:---------:|:--------------|
| _italics_   | **bold**  | `monospace`   |
| right-aligned | centered text  | left-aligned |

Another table:

| Column    | Another Column |
|-----------|----------------|
| Text | This is a very long text block which should successfully stretch to respect the cell size; it will reach 100% of the parent div width if necessary. Let's see if it worked! |

# Syntax Highlighting

Using Markdown highlighting:

```python
def testing():
    print("Hello", "world!")
```

A very long line of code:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // TODO: write some code here which gets executed as part of the righteous Java pizza store that every student has to write
}
```
